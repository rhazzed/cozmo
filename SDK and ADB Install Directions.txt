# create install folder
cd ~
mkdir android-sdk-linux

# move zip to install folder and extract
mv Downloads/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip android-sdk-linux
extraxt platform-tools-latest-windows.zip IN the android-sdk-linux folder you created

# check to see if adb is present
cd android-sdk-linux/platform-tools
ls adb

#add PATH to your .bashrc (as user)
export PATH=${PATH}:~/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools

# save and load .bashrc
source .bashrc

# confirm adb is in path
which adb    (should display adb path)

###  ANDROID DEVICE SETUP ###
Tap seven (7) times on the Build Number listed under Settings -> About Phone.
Then, under Settings -> Developer Options, enable USB debugging.

# in Ubuntu, type:
adb devices
There should be atleast 1 device found. 
If not, check your ADB installation, enable USB debugging and re-plug you phone in to Odroid or Pi3

Success Example:
List of devices attached
88148a08    device

if output shows "unauthorized" instead of "device" you need to approve/trust the fingerprint access on you phone  (look for popup window on your phone)
this is necessary for your phone to communicate to your device.

### INSTALL DONE! ###

Put Cozmo on charging dock (wake up)
Connect your android device to Cozmo's wifi
Start the Cozmo app on Android device
Once connected, go in Cozmo app settings and enable SDK
Enjoy  :)
