# cozmo

This project is a collection of Python 3 code (NOTE: COZMO WILL NOT WORK WITH PYTHON 2.x!), scripts, configuration files and support utilities needed during our experiments with the Cozmo robot.

While high-minded, with lofty goals, we have only a limited supply of beer and Rockstar, so... lowered expectations are welcome!


- Cheers
